    This contains the OAuth2 configuration details that are used for demonstrating
    authentication with IDPs. By default, all providers are disabled until you modify this file
    to provide your own configuration details.

    NOTE: under normal circumstances, it is not recommended to include client secrets into your
    apps. This allows others to easily impersonate your service during authorization requests,
    and if the user has already consented to a set of scopes requested on the device in question,
    malicious apps may be able to freely acquire tokens for the user. Client secrets are not
    strictly required for OAuth2 to function securely; best practice for OAuth2 on mobile devices
    is currently not to use client secrets, but many IDPs still require them to acquire refresh
    tokens, which are essential to a good user experience in mobile apps.
